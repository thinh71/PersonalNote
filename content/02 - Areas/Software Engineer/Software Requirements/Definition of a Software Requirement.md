At its most basic, a software requirement is a property that must be exhibited by something in order to solve some problem in the real world.

It may aim to automate part of a task for someone to support the business processes of an organization, to correct shortcomings of existing software, or to control a device-to name just a few of the many problems for which software solutions are possible. The ways in which users, business processes, and devices function are typically complex. By extension, therefore, the requirements on particular software are typically a complex combination from various people at different levels of an organization, and who are in the one way of another involved or connected with this feature from the environment in which the software will operate.
