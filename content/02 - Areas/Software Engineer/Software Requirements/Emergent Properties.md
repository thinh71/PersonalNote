Some requirements represent emergent properties of software-that is, requirements that can not be addressed by component but that depend on how all the software components interoperate. The throughput requirements for a call center would, for example, depend on how the telephone system, information system, and the operators all interacted under actual operating conditions. Emergent properties are crucially dependent on the system architecture.
